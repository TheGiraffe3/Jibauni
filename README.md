# Adding the Jibauni

This is a plugin for the free, open-source game Endless Sky (endless-sky.github.io). 

## General Information
This plugin re-adds the Sheragi, and also adds a robotic faction called the Diba and a species named the Jibauni. 

I am currently focusing on the Jibauni most, so the Sheragi and Diba are quite lacking in many respects. 

The Jibauni mostly use human ship sprites, which I am hoping will change soon (see [Contributing](#Contributing)). 

You can find the fork of Endless Sky with the Jibauni integrated [here](https://github.com/Alrodel/endless-sky/tree/Jibauni).

## Jibauni

The Jibauni are the only ones to have a resemblance of a storyline right now. They and their non-weapon outfits are mainly based around fuel. They also have slowing damage in their systems.
I am aiming to make the Jibauni about T1.



## Diba

The Diba are a faction of robots much like the Kor Mereti and Kor Sestor, except for these are controlled by an escaped Alpha. 
I am aiming for the Diba to be slightly more powerful then humans, but only a bit.



## Sheragi

This plugin also re-adds the Sheragi, and uses outfits and ship sprites taken from Petersupes' [Sheragi Rebirth](https://github.com/Petersupes/sheragi-rebirth) plugin (with permission). These Sheragi do not use the Emerald Sword, though they have a less powerful version of it called the Platinum Spear, which does not have a Dragonflame Cannon.
The Sheragi are closer to T1.3, because they focus on _massive_ ships.



## Contributing

I would welcome any help making this plugin. If possible, the things I need most help on are making ship and outfit sprites, preferably with .blend and .gimp files to go along.
I have sprites for the Diba/Sheragi, but not the Jibauni.
It would be nice if they followed a more uniform pattern than they do now.
