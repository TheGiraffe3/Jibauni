# Adding the Jibauni

This is a plugin for the free, open-source game Endless Sky (endless-sky.github.io). 

It is in very active development and will be changing often. 
It may break quite a few things, so use at your own risk. 

## General Information
This plugin readds the Sheragi, and also adds a robotic faction called the Diba and a species named the Jibauni. 

I am currently focusing on the Jibauni most, so the Sheragi and Diba are quite lacking in many respects. 

The Jibauni mostly use human ship sprites, which I am hoping will change soon (see Contributing). 

You can find my fork of Endless Sky with the Jibauni integrated [here](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/endless-sky/tree/Jibauni).

## Jibauni

The Jibauni are the only ones to have a resemblance of a storyline right now. They and their non-weapon outfits are mainly based around fuel. They also have a good bunch of slowing damage that happens in their systems, and there is/will be a disabled remover that gets rid of disabled ships. 



## Diba

The Diba are a faction of robots much like the Kor Mereti and Kor Sestor, except for these are controlled by an escaped Alpha. 
They currently use Mereti sprites, which should change.



## Sheragi

This plugin also readds the Sheragi, and uses outfits and ship sprites mainly taken from @Petersupes' plugin Sheragi Rebirth. These Sheragi do not use the Emerald Sword, though they have a less powerful version of it called the Platinum Spear, which does not have a Dragonflame Cannon. 



## Contributing

I would welcome any help making this plugin. If possible, the things I need most help on are making ship and outfit sprites, preferably with .blend and .gimp files to go along. It would be nice if they followed a more uniform pattern than they do now. Sounds would also be appreciated.
