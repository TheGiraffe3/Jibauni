		description "Successive raider designs have been the Korath warship of choice for plundering neighboring species for generations. Named for a celebrated captain who gave her life to ensure her crippled vessel made it back to port with its desperately needed cargo of stolen fish, the Palavret-Class Raiding Ship continues that grim tradition."
		description "	Like all Exile ships, the Palavret has been adapted to house as many Korath as possible, as comfortably as possible, inflating its size beyond similarly armed warships. The spaceborne construction techniques employed allow for the ship's easy replacement, facilitating continued raids of nearby systems."
