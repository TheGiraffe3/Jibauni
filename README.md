# Adding the Jibauni

**The Jibauni have been PRed to vanilla Endless Sky. The pull request is here: [#10867](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/10867)**

This is a plugin for the free, open-source game [Endless Sky](endless-sky.github.io). 

## General Information
This plugin adds a robotic faction called the Diba and a species named the Jibauni.

The Jibauni mostly use human ship sprites, which I am hoping will change soon (see [Contributing](#Contributing)). 

You can find the fork of Endless Sky with the Jibauni integrated [here](https://github.com/Alrodel/endless-sky/tree/Jibauni).

## Jibauni

The Jibauni and their non-weapon outfits are mainly based around fuel. They also have slowing damage in their systems.
I am aiming to make the Jibauni about T1.



## Diba

The Diba are a faction of robots much like the Kor Mereti and Kor Sestor, except for these are controlled by an escaped Alpha. 
I am aiming for the Diba to be slightly more powerful then humans, but only a bit.
