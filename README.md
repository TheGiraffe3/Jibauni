# Adding the Jibauni

This is a plugin for the free, open-source game Endless Sky (endless-sky.github.io). 

## Jibauni

The Jibauni are the only ones to have a resemblance of a storyline right now. They and their non-weapon outfits are mainly based around fuel. They also have a good bunch of slowing damage that happens in their systems, and there is/will be a disabled remover that gets rid of disabled ships. 
The Jibauni currently use normal human ship sprites, but that will change as soon as I can get someone to make me better ones. 

## Diba

The Diba are a faction of robots much like the Kor Mereti and Kor Sestor, except for these are contolled by an escaped Alpha. 
They are the only ones whose ship sprites I made, and so they need better ones. 

## Sheragi

This plugin also readds the Sheragi, and uses outfits and ship sprites mainly taken from Petersupes' plugin Sheragi Rebirth. These Sheragi do not use the Emerald Sword, though they have a less powerful version of it called the Platinum Spear that does not have a Dragonflame Cannon. 

### WARNING: This plugin is not remotely finished and will probably have many problems. 
### Use at your own risk.
