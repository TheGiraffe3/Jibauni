# Overview

This will detail my plans for a new T1 species, the Jibauni. Their specialty is fuel-based everything. 
It also contains information about a rival, the robotic Diba. These are controlled by an Alpha, and their specialty is guns that can rotate slightly.
In addition, I am hoping to re-add a faction of Sheragi. They, like some other species, trade maneuverability for raw power. <!--, and have shield generators that are more powerful then other species, but which stop working for a bit when the shields are depleted. Petersupes made the most part of the Sheragi stuff [here](https://github.com/Petersupes/sheragi-rebirth). He also provided assets, which I have taken from [this repository](https://github.com/Petersupes/Sheragi-Rebirth-Assets). -->

Here is a picture of all my planned systems, besides Jibtrav.

## Jibauni

The Jibauni are a species that look like dinosaurs. Their speech, called Jibunese, should be filled with the letter R.
They will probably be using Heliarch translators to communicate.

<details>
<summary>History</summary>

Jibauni written history started sometime in the late 1500s, when the Jibauni became the dominant factor on their home planet of Baitoon. They figured out how to make non-hyperspace capable spacecraft around 2100, only to have invaders in ships painted green come from the East. These aliens were finally beaten off around 2240. With the knowledge they gained from disassembling the invaders' drives, they first made their version of the hyperdrive in 2250. _**Note: they are not that good at reverse-engineering, but with 140 years to work with they managed to break through.**_ After a 50-year period of colonization and good times, one clan in Almanhaq suddenly broke away from the main government, speedily followed by four more. These called themselves the _real_ Jibauni, and scornfully labeled the normal Jibauni the "Lazies." Fighting between the two has been going on ever since then.
Around 2400, a red-pink alien ship took off from a strange green anomaly that had been there ever since the Jibauni could remember, and hailed their homeworld of Baitoon in Jibunese, requesting permission to land. The Jibauni, after a long debate, let the ship land, but posted guards around it, for both their protection and to protect the foreigner from any dissatisfied Jibauni. The next day, the ship was gone, and one of their holy leaders, an Oracle, was missing. Reports came in of the ship passing through Sabibal, but no other traces were found.

Since the 2800s, the Jibauni have also found Heliarch ships coming in and mining asteroids from Quinlo. Because the Heliarch weapons/ships (even small ones) are so powerful, the Jibauni have lost many people while trying to disable their opponents. However, on rare occasions they manage to disable the Heliarch, and loot things from their ships. This is mainly translation devices, because they can't figure out how to get the Jump Drive (or anything else) out. Also, every time a Heliarch ship is disabled, it sends a distress call, and more Heliarch come in to help, repairing the disabled ship, which still has its Jump Drive.

In addition, small pirate ships (the biggest possible one being an Argosy) have come through the wormhole every now and then. (There is a set of Jibauni news about this.)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ships</summary>

The Jibauni ships have built-in slowing resistance, which costs fuel to use and automatically happens. Carried ships have slowing resistance without any cost, to keep them from being unable to move too frequently. I do not think this will cause balance problems with Detainers, because the ships are fighters.
Jibauni ships are faster than a lot of other T1 ships. However, they make up for this by being extremely fragile.
Some of them also have the "fuel mount" attribute, and will be able to carry Fuel-Leaks or Fuelers. See below.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Outfits</summary>

The Jibauni outfits, and indeed the Jibauni in general, are very fuel-based. Their weapons use fuel, and so do their engines. Their generators create fuel. To stop this from being unbalanced, I have made it so that you cannot put them on ships that are not made by the Jibauni.
They also have two special types of weapons, the Fuel-Leaks and Fuelers, which take away and grant fuel, respectively. All of these (except the Leak and er 10) have the attribute "fuel mount" in the negative, and so they cannot be installed on non-Jibauni ships either.
The Fuel ers/Leaks will will be important later in the storyline, but they will not be in an initial PR, especially because sprites for them will be difficult to plan.

_Note: the systems to the west that are uninhabited don't mean much until later in the plot line. At the beginning, they are just things for the player to explore with a JD, if they so please._


![areajibtrav](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/Jibauni/assets/145969603/e5158288-182c-499c-b2c5-e11d127e67ed)


The Jibauni also have a small amount of slowing damage happening in their systems, hence the built-in slowing resistance on their ships.
</details>

<details>
<summary>"Normal" Storyline</summary>

_Note: in an initial PR the player probably will only be able to do the first few missions, all the way back to Baitoon. The rest will come later._

The storyline starts when landing on Baitoon. A Jibauni named Kanlanmo comes up to the player, and asks them to take him to Taltahard, one jump south-west by west. (Communication is accomplished by the aid of a translation device looted from the Heliarch, though they are not revealed to the player.)
After doing so, the player will take Kanlanmo to the rest of the Normal planets, culminating with taking him back to Baitoon.

30 days later, the player is called to make the rounds again, picking up Jibauni ships as they go. A battle starts in Baitoon while the player is on Kanlil, and `first` `last` must go and save the Jibauni there, being auto-launched if there are still Rebel ships alive. Upon finishing this mission you start receiving a salary of 1,500 credits, which can be adjusted if need be.
At this point, the player must make a decision to either go attack the Rebels in Kateaza, or stay and build up strength. No matter what the player chooses, though, a headstrong Jibauni captain attacks immediately. The player is tasked with going to rescue her, and after landing in the Station of Power, attacking Almanhaq.
In the Almanhaq battle, the Jibauni are beaten off, and must regroup. The player is tasked with bringing a Fury, a Sparrow, and a Scrapper to Jibauni space for study. Fleets are increased on both sides. 
The rest will come later.
</details>

<details>
<summary>"Rebel" Storyline</summary>

In first contact, the player will eventually have the option to decide that the Rebel Jibauni are right and the Normal are wrong. If this happens, the Rebel storyline can begin.
To begin with, you are tasked with fetching some alien warships (3 Scrappers), which take part in the Battle for Baitoon.
The player leads the assault, but is driven back by sheer numbers. You must then defend Almanhaq from a Jibauni counterattack, but with the whole Rebel armada on your side, this is quite easy. Landing on Almanhaq, you are given a Rebel license and a salary of 1,200 credits. (This also can be adjusted.) Fleets on both sides are increased.

</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>Combined Storyline</summary>
After a somewhat long wait starting when the Almanhaq battle ends (wait â‰ˆ250 days), the player is called to Jibauni space to help settle a peace treaty. Note: I haven't decided a good way this could be done. The signing goes well, and the Normal Jibauni and the Rebels intermingle. 
In addition, Hajay is mysteriously linked to Hanal, and that space opens up for colonization.
There is then a government-sponsored mission chain causing a planet in Sollo to be colonized. After this string, a timer is set. Once this timer runs out, or the Emerald Sword is discovered (whichever is later), the next phase starts.

The aliens whose ships are painted green from six hundred years ago invade again, with minions of the alien ship that kidnapped the Oracle coming with them. At this point, Sheraig and Rabalin are linked, Sabibal and Sol Diba are linked, and Sheraig is linked to Sol Diba. All Sheragi systems and Sol Diba are unhidden.
Also, Mimson is linked to Draig, and 30 days later Draig is linked to Mimson, though this is not known to the Jibauni (or the main body of the Sheragi) at the time.
Sheragi come pouring in from the South and conquer Taltahard. The Diba occupy Sabibal, although there is nowhere that _they_ can land. The Rebels, however, stay true to their alliance and an influx of them drive the Diba out of the system with the Jibauni seat of government. The Sheragi are also repulsed.

A battle is started by the Jibauni to take Sheraig, in which there is a stalemate. The Jibauni finally draw back, and the player is asked to go through Sheragi space to get the Sheragi Pirates to help them attack the normal Sheragi. The Sheragi Pirates agree to attack in 40 days, and so `first` `last` has to get back to Jibauni space and gather an attack force in time to make the attack on the specified date.
The battle culminates in the Jibauni capturing Sheraig. Another battle later, and Somitaw is under Jibauni control.

<details>
<summary>Side Mission Chains</summary>

There is a culture conversation on Kanlil which can will up turning into a small mission chain where you help a Jibauni get a new ship.

I am planning on having at some point (preferably after the storyline is completed) a set of missions in which the Heliarch increase force to mine asteroids in Quinlo, but the combined forces of the Sheragi and Jibauni are enough to drive them away, though without injuring them too seriously.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ties with other factions</summary>


Diba: Hostile because of the kidnapping.


Sheragi: Hostile because of invasion hundreds of years ago.


Each other (Rebel/Normal fight): Hostile because of revolution and name-calling.


Heliarch: Hostile because of the Heliarch stealing valuable resources.


Pirates: Hostile, because why would they like each other? Pirates are pirates...

<!-- For Quarg/Drak/Pug interventions, I am not really sure how to accomplish this while fitting in with my lore. -->

The lore reason for the Quarg not living nearby to keep an eye on the Jibauni is that they are still bitter about the thievery of their rings by the Heliarch.

The Drak don't really care right now, leaving it to the Quarg to decide what to do.

I'm not sure of a good reason the Pug wouldn't intervene, because "the Pug are used enough already" definitely doesn't make sense lore-wise.

</details>

## Diba

The Diba are a robot faction under the control of a very bad "person," a. k. a. an Alpha...

<details>
<summary>History</summary>

The Diba are a faction of robots controlled by an Alpha who escaped from the original scattering in the Alpha Wars. It went through the wormhole in Jibtrav, landing on Huyya, where it kidnapped a Jibauni Oracle and went to an uninhabited system, whose stars move slightly. It has been there ever since, creating robotic warships, and getting ready to fight when the Jibauni come to get their revenge.
The Oracle is also still with it, trying to find a good way to escape. This will be a pivotal point later on in the story.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ships</summary>

One of the reasons their ships are interesting follows. They have "turrets," but the turrets have limited rotation arcs and so are basically slightly movable guns, which is what they are in lore.
The ships have built-in engines, energy generation, and the attribute "diba gun port" with a negative number set to however many "turrets" they have, being 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 respectively for the Llama, Ithquaya, Arbquaya, Tamquaya, and Tahquaya.
All Diba ships also have one bunk, so the Alpha can escape any time.
The Llama <!-- (https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/Jibauni/blob/aa40c5c176653dbc575df9cd035533f02e5b89cf/data/Diba/ships.txt#L14) -->is a fighter whose single turret has a limited rotation arc of 10 degrees and which has 100 cargo space. I can nerf this if desired, but the other Diba ships have a maximum cargo of 8, so I'm not sure it's too bad.
Thanks to Petersupes for the sprite.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Outfits</summary>

The Diba have one outfit: the Diba Laser Turret, which is an improved version of the Heavy Laser Turret. It has the attribute "diba gun port" 1, which means that all Diba Laser Turrets will stay on the ship they came on. They are also unlootable, so the Diba Laser Turret can never be on a non-Diba ship.
The Diba have no other outfits.

![dibasystem](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/Jibauni/assets/145969603/19ac32c5-1d6c-4b8b-adb5-2f147aad654f)

<!-- (Sorry, this is max zoom. Ignore the part of the picture that is not Sol Diba.) -->

This Diba base is south of Jibauni space, and has no _natural_ hazards. The system is out of jump range of any other system, and so is only accessible a while into the storyline.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Storyline</summary>

There will be none, unless an Alpha storyline is added someday. Because you're a normal human, the Alpha hates you too much to let you do anything related to the Diba "empire".
However, a way to get further in the Jibauni storyline may be to destroy the Diba leader's personal ship. 
I am not sure how to make it so that you can only see one of these ships at a time without use of the Author mechanic though.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ties with other factions</summary>

I'm not sure that "ties" is the right way to put it...

Hostile with every faction except the Alphas are the ties. The Alphas are the same way in-game.
</details>

## Sheragi

This is another faction of the Sheragi that did not want civil war (like the crew of the Emerald Sword). These ran away West while others of their kind were fighting.

<details>
<summary>History</summary>

It took them more than ninety-nine thousand years to get past Coalition space and reach Jibauni space, where they were opposed.
After building a station, and then getting beaten away by the Jibauni, they continued to another region of space, which they named Alrodel. Here they stopped, and built factories and homes, and have become a great nation once more.

But, there is one set of Sheragi that is unsatisfied with the way the new government is turning out. These have turned pirate and started attacking the Sheragi, much like human pirates and the Navy.
Except for these pirates only have one entry point into their four systems.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ships</summary>

The Sheragi ships are bulky and powerful. Their chief disadvantage is being quite slow. They do not use the Emerald Sword, although later in the storyline there could possibly be one or two.
They will have ion resistance because of storms in Ejderha and surrounding systems.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Outfits</summary>

The Sheragi outfits are fairly balanced (I hope), and partly hybrid.
Their best weapon is probably the Kinetic Spear, a massive hunk of metal not unlike the ones the "Big Brother" threatens Earth with in FW. The biggest problem of the KS is its cost.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Location</summary>

The Sheragi live southwest of the Jibauni, here. 

![sheragispace](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/Jibauni/assets/145969603/5bd1bbda-65bd-440a-9727-fb0f8993c9a0)


All of the Sheragi systems are hidden until later in the Jibauni storyline.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Storyline</summary>

After the Sheragi appear and start attacking the Jibauni, you have the option to join the Sheragi side and battle the Jibauni and the Diba.
If you do this, you do not get help for the final battle against the Diba after the Sheragi and Jibauni make peace. More will come later.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Ties with other factions</summary>

Jibauni: Hostile, because they have been driven off.

Diba: Hostile, because the Diba are invading them.

Each other: Same as pirates in human space.

Pug: In theory this could be the Sheragi colony that the Pug got. I just liked the idea of the Sheragi not being dead permanently, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it must be a Pug colony (and my current planned lore doesn't think that either).

</details>


## Balance

Basically, the Jibauni are agile and fragile. T0.9 HP wise but quite powerful in matters of fuel, which is balanced by the fact that none of their good outfits can be installed on non-Jibauni ships.

The Diba are around T1.1 militarily, and have slightly shiftable gun ports. They do not specialize.

The Sheragi are around T1.25, the same level as the Hai. They have slight ion resistance, but their main focus is on tankiness.

## Closing thoughts

Like the Naltok, the Jibauni are not yet ready for PR to vanilla. They have no ship and outfit sprites that I can use (that I have .blends for), and I'm bad at using Blender.

<!-- Sprites would be appreciated, because though I can do the Diba ships (they are meant to look bad), I have found that I am terrible at using Blender in a way that produces good aesthetics.
The Sheragi have sprites for everything except the shield generators. -->

Any help at all is welcome, though Jibauni images are the most needed.
