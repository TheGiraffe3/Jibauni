# Adding the Jibauni

This is a plugin for the free, open-source game Endless Sky (endless-sky.github.io). 

## General Information
This plugin readds the Sheragi, and also adds a robotic faction called the Diba and a species named the Jibauni. 

The Jibauni will probably have the most missions, at least for a while. But you will be able to join the Rebel Jibauni and the Sheragi at some point.

The Jibauni currently use normal human ship sprites, but that will change as soon as I can get someone to make me better ones.

I am hoping to get this into vanilla at some point, once it's done, which will take a while.

There will be about six updates every week. 

Please ignore the storyline copy file, that is not for any useful purpose to the plugin. 

### WARNING: This plugin is not remotely finished and will probably have many problems. 
### Use at your own risk. 

## Jibauni

The Jibauni are the only ones to have a resemblance of a storyline right now, with three and a half missions. They and their non-weapon outfits are mainly based around fuel. They also have a good bunch of slowing damage that happens in their systems, and there is/will be a disabled remover that gets rid of disabled ships. 



## Diba

The Diba are a faction of robots much like the Kor Mereti and Kor Sestor, except for these are contolled by an escaped Alpha. 
They are the only ones whose ship sprites I made, and for that reason they need better ones. 



## Sheragi

This plugin also readds the Sheragi, and uses outfits and ship sprites mainly taken from @Petersupes ' plugin Sheragi Rebirth. These Sheragi do not use the Emerald Sword, though they have a less powerful version of it called the Platinum Spear that does not have a Dragonflame Cannon.
